### 1. Set Up Your Development Environment

- [x] Install Go on your machine. You can download it from the official [Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

### 2. Create Your Project Structure

- [x] Set up a new directory for your project.
- [ ] Inside the project directory, create subdirectories for different components (e.g., `templates` for HTML templates).

### 3. Create a Simple HTTP Server

- [ ] Write a basic Go program to create an HTTP server.
- [ ] Set up a route to handle the root URL ("/") and respond with a simple message.

### 4. Create a Basic HTML Template

- [ ] Create an HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) in the `templates` directory.
- [ ] Design a simple UI for your to-do list using HTML.

### 5. Serve HTML Content from Go

- [ ] Implement a handler function in Go to serve the HTML content to the client.
- [ ] Use the `html/template` package to render the HTML template.

### 6. Implement To-Do List Logic

- [ ] Create a data structure to represent tasks (e.g., a `Task` struct).
- [ ] Maintain a list of tasks in memory.
- [ ] Modify your HTML template to display the list of tasks.

### 7. Add CRUD Functionality

- [ ] Implement functionality to add a new task.
- [ ] Allow users to mark tasks as completed.
- [ ] Implement the ability to edit and delete tasks.

### 8. Enhance Interactivity

- [ ] Add JavaScript to your HTML to enhance interactivity (e.g., adding tasks without a page refresh).
- [ ] Explore client-side frameworks or libraries if you're interested.

### 9. Styling

- [ ] Optionally, improve the visual appeal of your to-do list by adding CSS.

### 10. Documentation

- [ ] Document your code using comments to explain key parts of your implementation.
- [ ] Write a README file explaining how to set up and run your application.

### 11. Testing

- [ ] Write simple tests for critical functions using Go's testing framework.

### 12. Version Control

- [ ] Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes to your project.

### 13. Deployment (Optional)

- [ ] Explore options for deploying your Go application (e.g., using cloud platforms like Heroku or AWS).

### 14. Learn and Iterate

- [ ] Throughout the process, refer to Go's documentation and resources to enhance your understanding.
- [ ] Feel free to iterate on your project, adding more features or refining existing ones.
